# FirstSow

Our project aims to revolutionize the agricultural industry by leveraging the power of IoT and Android app development to create a smart agriculture system. By integrating various sensors, such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors, we enable farmers to monitor crucial environmental parameters in real-time.

The core hardware component of our project is an Arduino board, which acts as the central hub for collecting sensor data. The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content in the soil, providing insights into irrigation needs. The temperature and humidity sensors track the environmental conditions, crucial for crop growth and disease prevention.

To make this data accessible and actionable, we have developed an Android app using Kodular, a powerful visual programming platform. The app serves as a user-friendly interface that farmers can access on their smartphones or tablets. It provides real-time data visualization, allowing farmers to monitor and analyze the sensor readings effortlessly.

The key features of our Android app include:

1. Real-time Sensor Data: The app displays the current values of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, providing farmers with immediate insights into their crops' health.

2. Historical Data Analysis: Farmers can view historical trends and analyze how environmental conditions have evolved over time. This feature helps in identifying patterns, making informed decisions, and optimizing crop growth strategies.

3. Notifications and Alerts: The app sends push notifications to farmers when certain predefined thresholds are crossed. For example, if soil moisture falls below a specific level, the farmer receives an alert, prompting them to take appropriate action.

4. Crop-Specific Recommendations: Our app incorporates a database of crop-specific information and provides customized recommendations based on the collected data. It suggests optimal irrigation schedules, planting times, and other crop management strategies.

5. Data Backup and Synchronization: We utilize Google Firebase, a cloud-based platform, to store and synchronize sensor data. This ensures that farmers can access their data from multiple devices and never lose valuable information.

By combining IoT technology, sensor integration, and Android app development, our smart agriculture project empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions, improve crop yields, and optimize resource utilization. It brings automation and intelligence to traditional farming practices, contributing to sustainable and efficient agriculture.
